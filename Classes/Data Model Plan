The plan for the Data Model (as outlined by RyanS).

- Build Data Model objects based on all the data model objects in the REST interface using RMModelObject for simplicity.
- Retrieve the data over the REST interface.
- Use libxml2 to parse REST results, place them in iVolunteerData.
- Backfill the mututable dictionaries with links to actual objects.
-- This is required by libxml2 is a SAX parser not a DOM parser, and we won't have all the objects resolved in sequence.
-- For example, if we pull in the OrganizationTypes first, the organization dictionary can't point to the actual 
   organization objects yet since wehaven't pulled them.  So instead we'll need to insert something like (uid,nil), and
   go back and fill the nil references with actual object references from iVolunteerData once we've visited all the REST collections.
- The should get us a good set of data to work with.  We'll have to be careful about all the circular refs when serializing out, 
  probably safer to not serialize any dictionaries and refill them at runtime.
- After that, we just need to make some DataSources for the treeviews.
